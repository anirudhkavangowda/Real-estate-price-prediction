# Real-estate-price-prediction
This project aims to predict real estate home prices in Bengaluru, India using a Linear Regression model. The prediction model is built upon the Bengaluru House Price Dataset, which has been meticulously prepared through data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering processes.

The predictive model utilizes the Scikit-Learn library for implementing Linear Regression. The attributes considered for prediction include square foot area, bedroom count, bathroom count, and location.

The interactive web application is developed using Flask for backend, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend. It provides users with the ability to estimate home prices based on their inputs.
